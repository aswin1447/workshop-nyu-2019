# Introduction to modeling and model fitting in psychophysics and neuroscience (2019)

This repository contains materials for an introductory workshop to modeling and model fitting in psychophysics and neuroscience, part of which I presented at the Bristol Neuroscience group in May 2019 ([event link](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neuroscience/events/diary/2019/ndforum-8may.html)). I gave slightly different versions of this tutorial at several other institutions and summer schools (see [here](http://luigiacerbi.com/tutorials/)).

The main file for the tutorial is the script [ModelingTutorial.m](https://github.com/lacerbi/workshop-bristol-2019/blob/master/ModelingTutorial.m).

To run some of the model-fitting algorithms in the tutorial you need to download and install the following MATLAB toolboxes:
  - Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS): https://github.com/lacerbi/bads
  - Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC): https://github.com/lacerbi/vbmc
